# koreader.patches
some koreader patches made for my own usage. If prefix PT they need Project title plugin

## 2-pt-list-datafromfilename
Project title : Don't use metadata but filename to display author, series and title in project title list views

## 2-pt-list-disable-prbar
 Project title : Disable progress bars for finished and new books but keep the marker

 ## 2-pt-list-localize-status
 Project title : change the language of books status (new, reading, on hold) without changing all koreader UI language
